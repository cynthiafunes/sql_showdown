3714,6163,Thanks! Much simpler than what I wrote
3652,6163,Thinking in variables? What else could I think in? Some background. I know a little PASCAL and am using this as a project to learn Python.

10522,5794,"Thanks Tenpn. I am looking for a way to find if the file, needs an updated, has it been modified, or it needs to patched. So you have fair idea of what your sandbox is upto.   I will check out the manual for resolve and ""reconcile offline work"".  And yes, your answer helped. Thanks."
10646,5794,"Thanks for pointing to the scripts. I agree on the philosophy. I know what I want and it is me who can make it (via script).   For reason unknown, I find Perforce documentation to be cryptic, I need to get into the documentation."

9931,9867,Together you and Mike have answered it. Thank you!
9937,9867,This one popped into my head an hour after posting the question. For the amount of data I'm crunching (not that much) I would have no problems churning through a bunch or queries. Might want to change time <= end_time to time < end_time to avoid double-counts.
8539,9882,Needing to install pskill is not ideal.  I'd prefer a solution that does not require me to install anything new.

6320,10476,The SQL query is out of my control :(. Thats the biggest problem I am having.
6315,10476,It is not exactly a clone. I guess manually iterating through the datatable is the only option..
6324,10476,The DataTable structure of the source is pathetic. I need to modify that to make it presentable to the UI..
6292,10476,"I need to explain a bit more. There is a filtering condition for copying the rows. So, a plain Copy() will not work."
6297,10476,Only specific rows. Updated the post too.
6303,10476,Would have worked. but the filtering condition is not that straightforward. It could change depending on some values.

8461,11950,Looks like that fixed things. I just deleted a couple of files from the text listing around that area. It got stuck on 9600 this time. Time to do some more deleting.
7993,12117,"This is the best solution.  I didn't realize that it was working at first because explorer cached my icon, so I also discovered that you can set the conditions via that icon properties in the resource viewer."
8826,12211,"Yes, it is a window passed from NSAPI call, but used in separate (child) process where the plugin actually works. XGetWindowAttributes gives information but not whether the window is covered, or - most important - scrolled down and partially visible, which is what I need."

8725,13817,How do you increase the TTL without using raw sockets in C?
8764,13817,The source code of traceroute.c expects the user to be root in order to rewrite the TTL of the packet - if you look at your distro traceroute is most likely setuid root.
8744,13817,What about packets with a custom TTL?
9518,14429,That's interesting.  Does Ruby do Win32 as thoroughly as Python?
9519,14836,"Yea, BizTalk is way too expensive even though, in truth, we could use some of the functionality (I think). It *seems* like XSLT is a nice middle-ground solution. But I need to do some perf tests. Our source XML is relatively small in size."

10342,14836,"re: ""if xml is the answer"" - are you referring here to the use of xml as an intermediate, internal, format for our data or as the outbound format? If the latter, then yea, we're forced to use it. xml as intermediate is probably me seeking flexibility and hitting the YAGNI wall..."
9577,14874,Thanks for the swift response. I don't want to read the stream however. I want to access the console buffer which is displayed in the command window. It would be similar to doing screen scraping on a html page.
9601,14874,I think I need to use the AttachConsole method of the console then the ReadConsoleOutput method to access a rectangle of character and attribute data. I don't know how to do this in managed code.

9739,15023,Thanks for replay. Because I want to get the position of the element I just inserted.
9759,15023,"But I don't know the margin and padding of the outter text, I want the element I inserted to appear like the outter text."

15533,7242,"Right - this is exactly the issue - there can be an infinite number of keys, different Foos can have different sets of them, etc. Obviously, on the backend I have this stored as a one-to-many relationship in the database - what I'm more concerned with now is making the API intuitive to use."
15534,7242,"Regardless of how I've actually stored them, I want the consumer of the API to be able to have the syntactic nicety of it *looking* like an object with properties. Does that make sense?"

13646,10034,I have used 'for xml' before even with schemas. The only down side is the performance hit you take on the database. Writing XML from a data set with a schema binding seems like an option though. I will try that.
11833,10034,"Yes, this would be a simple solution if the problem was equally simple. I need to be able to map directly to an existing XML schema.

13883,17691,Thanks for the response.  I'ma actually not talking about a rewrite.  I can use SharpDevelop for the actual conversion one page at a time.  I was more wondering about the incremental part as it relates to merging 2 asp.net web projects to be deployed as one.  Thanks!

14823,17872,Thanks for the excellent link!
14799,17872,"Thanks for your answer :-) I modified your code a little using this regular expression ""\\[\\]=(\w+)"""
17931,17978,"I am trying to run javascript within a jvm, but the javascript classes I want to use are not standard classes but rather are in this src file."
17924,17978,"No, as far as I know, the ashx file contains the javascript objects that the browser needs to do what it needs to do.  But I want to run this in a jvm and not in my browser.  So the url is not the script but the source of the compiled objects to use in a script."
18208,17987,"Yes , that seems to be the problem.. the loop goes on for more than 50 retries"
14624,17987,"This is an existing BIGTABLE, The Primary key is not an identity field."
15146,17987,It is generated by using the Rnd function and by passing a seed which is also a random number
15511,17987,"thought of storing the holes in another table and use it one by one (holes would be huge chunks), typically in sequence within the chunk.  But if it's sequential, wont the index page be a hotspot when the next row is being inserted and the same index page is being locked"
15502,17987,"No the new Id can be random. - could be sequential also. But if it's sequential, wont the index page be a hotspot when the next row is being inserted and the same index page is being locked?"
15492,17987,It was a Bad idea.. done a very long time back.. stuck with it now.
15489,17987,"yes the logic would need to have the maxID + 1 and then a check o see if that exists already, and if so, then generate another ID, check again.. etc. But is there any logic that gives me a number from the available numbers that are not used so that i dont have to insert.. get the error, try again.."
15479,17987,"The check is what's in place now, but the check loops many times and wastes database time and locks out other transactions waiting on this one to complete.."
15212,17987,"Yes, But if we sequence the Primary key, we need to worry about the Index page being locked when multiple inserts happen to the table."
15204,17987,"Yes, this is the current process, generate an ID and check if it's used. but this check goes on and on when the random numbers are already in the table."
15190,17987,Many thanks for your reply.. Some more details have been added to the question
15192,17987,This is the current approach. But the loop goes on...
15217,17987,Database & Table already exist. we have the seed also a random number.
14758,18010,I am using IIS so this is probably the route I'd want to go. Thanks! I suppose it won't matter that the remote site is on a Linux server...
15374,18116,one reason to look it up at run time is to figure out how many columns it has and what their types are.
15405,18198,will this beat reflection?
15408,18198,can it beat reflection?
15397,18198,"from that link - In the .NET Framework version 2.0 and later, demands for identity permissions are ineffective if the calling assembly has full trust."
15441,18198,"ironically, this same assembly is being loaded on demand using reflection. i guess there is no foolproof way to prevent this."
15422,18198,"i am not sure how that will help me..whether it is a .net assembly or a native assembly, anybody should be able to load it right.."
22813,18198,worth taking a look. thanks.
22814,18198,i check that. this is not an option for me. customers might not have internet connectivity.
22815,18198,i tried searching too. could not find any.
22821,18198,oops it is good but expensive solution for me :(
17240,18253,Good call on default parameters and the links.  MSDE is why we stuck with Access for so long.  I'm glad SQLExpress is less trouble.
17237,18253,"Thanks for the details! How do the clients ""find"" the server on the first install?  I heard of one company required you map the S: drive to an installation folder on the server, and they picked up the db settings.  Or maybe you could export a config file that you import to clients?"
17211,18253,"We like the ""file mode"" (I think they call it ""in process"") for single user.  But for multi-users you have to install SQLExpress on a server (or at least on one of the workstations) where the shared file is."
15559,18253,Too much data and we'd go to SQL Server Standard.
15571,18253,"So just let them install SQL Express, and give good instructions for entering a connect string in the app?"
15574,18253,A couple of hours for me? Or a couple of hours for my customers to install it?
